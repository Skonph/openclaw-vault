PROJECT: OpenClaw Autonomous Options System v4
ACCOUNT: Alpaca Paper Trading
CAPITAL: ~$15,927 | DATE: 2026-07-01 00:20

RULESET v4.0:
- Conviction ≥75/100 | IV Rank ≤40% | IV Last ≤45% | Premium $0.30-$0.60
- Spread ≤$3 | Price $10-$40 | DTE 25-40 days
- Earnings ban ±14 days | OI ≥500 both legs
- Bid >$0.00 | Bid-ask ≤$0.10/leg | Max 1 position
- Events Calendar auto-checked (Tradier) | Conviction scored automatically
- IV Last >45% = auto-reject (L019)

PIPELINE v4 (fully autonomous):
- Events check: Tradier fundamentals/calendars (±14 day ban)
- Conviction: rule-based offline scorer (upgrades to Claude API if key present)
- Auto-execution: vault_updater executes on clear + conviction pass
- Position size: fixed $200 risk per trade
- Skip conditions: Iron Condor (4-leg pending), events uncertain
- Notifications: Telegram per action + nightly summary + 7:30 AM morning report

NOVA ROLE:
- Review execution log and answer questions about trades
- Assist with manual execution of skipped orders if calendar verified
- Strategy review and next-step planning
- No independent market data generation
